# Multi-Splay_Tree

This project implements a MultiSplay Tree in C++, a specialized binary search tree structure that combines splay tree and multi-splay tree concepts to optimize the efficiency of tree operations. A MultiSplay Tree is designed to perform splay operations on multiple nodes simultaneously, thus enhancing the performance of search operations and dynamically maintaining a balanced tree structure.
